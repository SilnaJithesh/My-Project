Embedded code for An Autonomous Health monitoring system for animals
The autonomous Zigbee-based health monitoring system serves as a reliable and efficient system for efficiently monitoring the animal health. The human intervention needed is much reduced by this system. It is much cheaper in cost, consumes less power and there is no more a need for the veterinarian to be in the farm to check the animal state of health. He can get the monitored values in his mobile as and when needed. Smart sensors offer the promise of significant advances in medical treatment. Networking multiple smart sensors into an application-specific solution to combat disease is a promising approach, which will require research with a different perspective to resolve an array of novel and challenging problems. As wireless networks of sensors are developed for biomedical applications, the knowledge gained from these implementations should be used to facilitate the development of sensor networks for new applications. Expeditious development of implanted smart sensors to remedy medical problems presents clear benefits to individuals as well as society as a whole.
